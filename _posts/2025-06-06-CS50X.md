I'm on the Harvard's CS50X course by Prof. David Malan.
The CS%)X course is divided into 11 weeks of learning with problem sets per week. It is self paced so you can take your time.
The CS50X course teaches Programming and Computer Science basics. It is a fundamental course for technical and non-technical people
